						<h3>HISTORY</h3>
						<p>GameSpot is a video gaming website that provides news,
							reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video
							games. The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete
							Deemer, Vince Broady and Jon Epstein. It was purchased by ZDNet,
							a brand which was later purchased by CNET Networks. CBS
							Interactive, which purchased CNET Networks in 2008, is the
							current owner of GameSpot. In addition to the information
							produced by GameSpot staff, the site also allows users to write
							their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site's forums.</p>

				<p>GameSpot UK (United Kingdom) was started in October 1997 and
					operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the
					British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site.
					During this period, GameSpot UK won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical
					Publishers Association interactive) award for best website, and
					was short listed in 2001. Following the purchase of ZDNet by
					CNET, GameSpot UK was merged with the main US site. On April 24,
					2006, GameSpot UK was relaunched. In a similar fashion, GameSpot
					AU (Australia) existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with
					Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local
					version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003,
					Gamespot.com.au content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was
					fully re-launched mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local
					reviews, special features, local pricings in A$, Australian release
					dates, and more local news. GameSpot Japan in its current form
					launched in 2007. It provides Japanese video game industry news,
					previews, reviews, features, and videos as well as translated
					articles from the other GameSpot sites.</p>
